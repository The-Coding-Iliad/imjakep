        <p>This was a long journey which required perseverence to complete. Through the beginning of a pandemic, putting
          travel and the rest of life in general on hold, it wasnt easy. <!-- But I could not have done it without the loving
          support of my family and friends. If I had to do it all over again I would, I learned so much about management
          and the inner workings of business that I apply almost daily>.--></p>
        <p>
          Having finished my MBA program and not wanting to remain idle for more than 6 months, I decided to acquire my ITIL certificate. This has proved valuable in my interactions with the HelpDesk team members with which I
          interact, and gives good insight on how to structure my own post-live support matrices.

        <h5>Major Contributions</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>MuleSoft Implementation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Within 18 months of joining Vice Media the team whom I Project Managed in Wrike, had completely replaced the
          previous Dell Boomi application with MuleSoft Middleware. This Middleware connected our ERP system (NetSuite)
          with our expense reports application Concur, our vendor payment system Coupa, our CRM SalesForce, and a
          in-house
          developed application for Video Tagging called Service Projects. Despite the high turn-over rate, we were able
          to map all data and execute their configurations within a mix of real-time and batched API's.

          Thanks to MuleSoft's ability to recicyle the use of it's API's this will change the way data is passed
          throughout Vice Media Group, and it will continue to serve the organization long into the future, as Vice
          realizes its goal to transition from a point-to-point integration structure to a hub-and-spoke data web. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In House Application Development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As my first true SDLC project that I managed in Jira with a team of Front-End, Back-End & Full-Stack
          Developers,
          this was a fantastic oppurtunity to wet my appetite to learn more about coding. The application was meant
          amalgamate information from disparate system reports into a single website with an easily navigable UI for
          users
          to create their own custom reports, without needing to download these individual reports and collate them in
          excel files.

          Seeing them run through their sprints and complete pull requests with a smile and seeing how they could work
          independantly on their own tasks and still come together and help each other is what truly inspired me to
          learn
          Full-Stack.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>NetSuite Projects</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Alot of firsts for me in this company, as this was also my first time working with an ERP system! I rolled up
          my
          sleeves and helped the NetSuite team complete projects such as the configuration of Budget Code Line Items,
          Deferred Expense Release Module, 1099 year end reporting among others.

          As a project based organization, meaning all revenue and expenses are allocated to projects managed in
          NetSuite,
          Vice had a very customized environment which proved to be a challenge in its maintenance. I not only helped
          them
          complete their projects, but also brought a sense of transperency and stability as they was a lot of churn
          within the team
        </p>
        <h4>Education</h4>
        <p>
          Even though I was in the middle of my MBA program and Full Time work I managed to get another EHR
          Certification in EpicCare Ambulatory Systems. This required multiple trips to Madison, WI through Jan-Feb 2021
          aaccompanied by multiple exams.

        <ul>
          <li>Modernizing Medicine EHR Implementation </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Allow me to paint the scene: 28 seperate clinics spread among 4 states, 9 seperate systems, 1 technical
          resource and a 6 month time-frame. We succesfully consolidated the data from these systems onto a single SaaS
          Electronc Health Record System while maintaining normal business operations within half a year. Not to mention
          the upgrading of our patient onboarding system, Phreesia, which resulted in a 500k uptick in accounts
          recievable within the first 3 months.


          The coordination of catering would be enough to drive people up a wall. I would consider this assignment my
          Coup de Gras in the EHR space. The hardwork and breakneck speed in which the team completed this project was
          incredible, and could never have been completed without Daphne, so a big shout out to her!</p>
        <h4>Education</h4>
        <p>
          In the middle of my assignment with Tricenna it became apparent that the traditional waterfall methodoloy that
          I learned in my PMP training would not be sufficient. I set to fixing that by obtaining my Certified Scrum
          Master (CSM) Certificate.

          <li>Business Requirements Document: EHR</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Imagine lil' ol me walking into a park avenue high rise office building in the best off the rack suit I could
          find, suffering from imposter syndrome among the high profile muckity-mucks. Despite this, my short term
          contract with the NFL gave me the oppurtunity to have a lunch meeting with the countries largest Ambulatory
          EHR software provider, flew me around the country to attend NFL conferences, and had me going to locker rooms
          to meet with athletic trainers. This was EHR on a different level. A completely custom source code with its
          own unique team of developers and support staff created solely for the NFL. It was my job to not only make
          sure it's use continued with minimal problems, but also to collect and compose requirements to be developed
          for the upcoming 2019 season.

          Stakeholders in this environment were not playing on the same team, and this is not just a figure of speech.
          Workarounds, were often considered competitive advantage so consensus building was paramount. By the end of
          the 2018 season, an extensive backlog was curated compiled into a BRD and passed onto the development team at
          e-Clinical Works.

        <h4>Education</h4>
        <p>
          After the success I enjoyed with the Mental Health Department Implementation at YAI, I decided to formalize my
          project management skills by getting my PMP. Easily the hardest single test I took in my life, and I am a good
          tester. On my 2nd attempt I passed after a year of studying, and I have been leveraging this education and
          enhancing it ever since.

          was decided for me. I had grown close with my colleagues with monthly happy hours I coordinated, a vacation to
          Iceland with one of them, I even ended up meeting my now wife there. So needless to say I was loathe to move
          on, but I did what was needed and bid farewell to YAI.</p>

          <li>Onboarding the Mental Health Department</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          An entire Line of Business was performing their work on paper, just as they had always done, just as the most
          of world did until the HITECH Act made it too lucrative to not use an EHR. I was tasked with bringing them
          onto the enterprise EHR within 6 months. I worked closely with end users gathering requirements, I worked
          independently to develop the system to match these requirements, I worked closely with the executive team to
          keep them apprised of the status via dashboards created on Google Workspace, and lastly i worked closely with
          the end users as I provided them training and Go - Live support.

          This project is what helped me pivot from closing tickets as an analyst to functioning as a high performing
          project manager. This was the initial success that would catapult my EHR career.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Grant Program Management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Rarely in the IT space do we have the oppurtunity to generate revenue directly. We are often considered cost
          centers, which enable the rest of the business to function. Not the case when the organization is obtaining
          over $500K in grant revenue as a direct result of your use of the EHR system. The organization would seek out
          both federal and state grant money, and then task me with changing workflows in the system and delivering
          reports on this data to obtain these grants.

          Keeping the business humming along for over 800 daily users by closing tickets, implementing new HL7
          interfaces, performing industry required updates to workflows like the ICD-9 ICD-10 transition, and keeping up
          to date with the latest system upgrades was par for the course as part of this small team at YAI. I was able
          to learn the ins-outs of the clinics we supported and got the sense that I too was having a positive-impact on
          a patient population suffering from Intellectual Developmental Disabilities that is in desperate need of care.
